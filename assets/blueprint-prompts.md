## 4. CINEMATIC — Class 66 Freight (Modern Diesel)

Dramatic cinematic hero-shot rendering of a Class 66 diesel locomotive hauling freight wagons. Moody atmospheric lighting: golden hour, volumetric fog, rain-slicked tracks in the British countryside. Depth of field: sharp focus on the locomotive, beautifully blurred background with rolling green hills. Hyperrealistic rendering with metallic reflections on the yellow and grey EWS livery, exhaust effects, motion blur on wheels. Low-angle three-quarter perspective showing the locomotive's imposing scale and power. Subtle lens flare from headlight, dynamic cloud formations in sky. Cinematic color grading: deep shadows, lifted blacks, warm highlights.
