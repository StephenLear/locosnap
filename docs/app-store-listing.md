## Description

**Spot. Snap. Collect.** LocoSnap is the first app that turns trainspotting into a digital collecting hobby.

**HOW IT WORKS**
Point your camera at any train — LocoSnap's AI instantly identifies the class, operator, and type. You'll get detailed specs, fascinating historical facts, and a rarity classification from Common to Legendary.

**COLLECT THEM ALL**
Every train you spot becomes a card in your Shed. Track unique classes, spot duplicates, and hunt for the rarest locomotives. From everyday commuter stock to heritage steam legends — build the ultimate collection.

**STUNNING BLUEPRINTS**
Every identification generates an engineering-style blueprint illustration. Choose from four premium styles: Technical, Vintage, Schematic, and Cinematic. Save them, share them, frame them.

**COMPETE & CLIMB**
See how your collection stacks up on global and regional leaderboards. Earn achievements, level up from Platform Newbie to Copping Legend, and maintain your daily spotting streak.

**COMPARE YOUR COLLECTION**
Place any two trains side by side to compare specs — speed, power, weight, and more. See which locomotive comes out on top.

**KEY FEATURES**
• AI-powered train identification from photos
